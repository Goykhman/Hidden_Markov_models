Here we provide our Python implementation of a well known Hidden Markov Model techniques:
forward/backward, Baum-Welch, and Viterbi algorithms. We have also written up a documentation
manual detailing the HMM class functionality.

We have tested the HMM class on a simulated random Hidden Markov processes, the test file is
also provided here.
